# WC2-Calculator

The Front End will display:

- two values using input fields;
- four commands buttons to select the types of mathematical operations: add, subtract, divide, multiply;
- a clear button that will empty the input fields

The Client will be bundle up the inputs and mathematical operator and then send it to the server. Once the Server receives the request, it will compute the numbers in one of four different ways:

addition,
subtraction
multiplication
division

Once the result of the mathematical operation is determined, it should be sent back down to the Client where it will be displayed on the Front End.
